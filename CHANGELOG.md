Changelog:
- **Added:** Backslash now allows adding styling characters as regular characters.
  - This is done by prefixing the character with backslash, e.g. `\*` would show just as `*` while just `*` would not show at all as it's being interpreted as a styling character.
- **Fix:** Markdown formatting is now not applied to commands being typed.
- **Fix:** Usernames in tab completion now have their underscores prefixed with backslash to prevent them from being italicized.
- **Fix:** Player names in the tab list no longer have markdown applied.
- **Fix:** When moving the cursor in an editor box (such as chat), the formatting will now be correctly applied.
  - Technically, this would also fix this bug in vanilla.
